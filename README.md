<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Script

This is a script written to avoid unnecessary movement of your hands when typing on the keyboard by mapping w a s d and i j k l to arrow keys and adding some additional functionality to avoid using the mouse. 

Current features:
* Capslock + W A S D and I J K L mapped to arrow keys.
* Capslock + å SC01B , . ' mapped to common programming characters such as { }, [ ] and < > 
* Capslock + 1 2 3 4 mapped to switch between virtual desktops.
* Capslock + T mapped to cycle Teams windows to easily switch between an open meeting and the normal teams client. 
* Capslock + O mapped to cycle Outlook windows to easily switch between open Outlook windows. 
* Capslock + B mapped to cycle open browser windows (EDGE) to easily switch between open browser windows. 
* Capslock + Ö mapped to open/focus on Windows Terminal.
* Capslock + C mapped to open/focus on Visual Studio Code.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started



### Installation

Install [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) 

My preferred way of installing Autohotkey is by using chocolatey 

```sh
choco install autohotkey
```

Then create a shortcut to the autohotkey.ahk file (if you associated .ahk files with Autohotkey) and place it in your startup folder to have it load everytime you start your computer.

## Acknowledgments

If you are getting into Autohotkey scripting do checkout the boards, I am by no means an expert Autohotkey scripter but a lot of the scripts I have written started out as examples posted in these boards, they are truly very helpful. I would have included the links to the place where I got this code but I have been using this since around when Windows 7 came out and the old forums have been archived.. anyhow if you were an active member of these boards you have my thanks.
